# PIG-GAME
a roll dice game 

A simple dice game called "Pig Game" built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS â€” from Jonas Schmedtmannâ€™s JavaScript course on Udemy.

ðŸŽ²Rules
- Two players take turns rolling a dice.
- On each turn, a player can roll as many times as they like â€” the result adds to their **current score**.
- If they roll a **1**, their turn ends and their **current score is lost**.
- The player can choose to **"Hold"** â€” which adds the current score to their **total score** and passes the turn.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
